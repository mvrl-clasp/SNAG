# SNAG
SNAG is a multimodal dataset consisting of co-collected eye movements and spoken descriptions produced during an image-inspection task. This dataset was collected from 30 observers whose eye movements and spoken descriptions were recorded as they inspected and describing 100 general-domain images. We also provide an image annotation tool (RegionLabeler) for manually labeling image regions with words. This dataset and the annotation tool were collected and developed by a group of researchers associated with the [Multidisciplinary Vision Research Lab](http://mvrl.cis.rit.edu/) and [Computational Linguistics and Speech Processing Lab](https://www.rit.edu/clasp/) at Rochester Institute of Technology.

# Description of the dataset
The dataset consists of six folders as described below:
#### 1. SnagImages: 
   This folder consists of the 100 general-domain images used in the data collection process. These images are a subset of the widely known Micorsoft Common Objects in Context (MSCOCO) dataset. The license for the MSCOCO dataset (REF) applies to these images. To see an example click: [1.jpg](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XvpJmHR01N0qPkSRWpjguUBTEDBF14Ie/view?usp=sharing)

#### 2. SnagGazeData:
   This folder contains eye movements for 30 observers, each viewing 100 images. It contains two folders:
   
   (1) SnagFixation: This folder contains 3000 csv files named *Aud&lt;Image Number&gt;_Obs&lt;Observer Number&gt;.csv*. Each file contains fixation data for the indicated image number and observer number.

   (2) SnagSaccade: This folder contains 3000 csv files named *Aud&lt;Image Number&gt;_Obs&lt;Observer Number&gt;.csv*. Each file contains saccade data for the indicated image number and observer number.

#### 3. SnagAudioWav:
   This folder contains 3000 audio files named *Aud&lt;Image Number&gt;_Obs&lt;Observer Number&gt;.wav*. Each file contains spoken descriptions for the indicated image number and observer number.

#### 4. SnagTranscribedJSON:
   This folder contains transcriptions of each audio file obtained with IBM Watson automatic speech recognition. The files are named *Aud&lt;Image Number&gt;_Obs&lt;Observer Number&gt;.json*. Each file contains the transcriptions for the indicated image number and observer number. Click to see an example: [Aud1_Obs31.json](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hEWgUPyS1UJfDXRGS_8hPLT_nVrsOw82/view?usp=sharing)
   
#### 5. SnagTranscribedTXT:
   This folder contains transcriptions for each audio file in TXT format. The files are named *Aud&lt;Image Number&gt;_Obs&lt;Observer Number&gt;.txt*. Each file contains the transcriptions for the indicated image number and observer number. Click to see an example: [Aud1_Obs31.txt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17QTthofS5GtZsAjeIrc-YqYsJ0R7YL_H/view?usp=sharing)
  
#### 6. SnagTranscribedTXT_Corrected_5Images:
   This folder contains the manually corrected ASR transcriptions for audio files (for 30 observers) corresponding to 5 images i.e. 150 files named *Aud&lt;Image Number&gt;_Obs&lt;Observer Number&gt;.txt*. Each file contains the manually corrected transcription for the indicated image number and observer number.

# RegionLabeler: Image Region Annotation Software
This folder contains RegionLabeler, the image annotation user interface as briefly described in the ACL paper. This software allows a user to draw boundary around regions in the image and check off words they can be annotated with. For more information, please refer to the README.txt within the folder.
